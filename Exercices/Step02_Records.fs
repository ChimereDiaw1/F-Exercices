module Step02_Records

(***
STEP 2 â€” Records (product types)
- Records are lightweight immutable aggregates with named fields.
- Use copy-and-update syntax { x with Field = newValue } to produce a new record based on an existing one.

let birthday p = { p with Age = p.Age + 1 }

    printfn "After birthday: %s (%d)" olderAlice.Name olderAlice.Age
